Coordinate Systems
------------------

Normalized Image Coordinates
````````````````````````````

The 2d position of a point in images is stored in what we will call *normalized image coordinates*.  The origin is in the middle of the image.  The x coordinate grows to the right and y grows downwards.  The larger dimension of the image is 1.

This means, for example, that all the pixels in an image with aspect ratio 4:3 will be contained in the intervals ``[-0.5, 0.5]`` and ``[3/4 * (-0.5), 3/4 * 0.5]`` for the X and Y axis respectively.

Normalized coordinates are independent of the resolution of the image and give better numerical stability for some multi-view geometry algorithms than pixel coordinates.


Pixel Coordinates
`````````````````

Many OpenCV functions that work with images use *pixel coordinates*.  In that reference frame, the origin is at the center of the top-left pixel, x grow by one for every pixel to the right and y grows by one for every pixel downwards.  The bottom-right pixel is therefore at ``(width -1, height - 1)``.


World Coordinates
`````````````````
The position of the reconstructed 3D points is stored in *world coordinates*.  In general, this is an arbitrary euclidean reference frame.

When GPS data is available, a topocentric reference frame is used for the world coordinates reference.  This is a reference frame that with the origin somewhere near the ground, the X axis pointing to the east, the Y axis pointing to the north and the Z axis pointing to the zenith.  The latitude, longitude, and altitude of the origin are stored in the ``reference_lla.json`` file.

When GPS data is not available, the reconstruction process makes its best to rotate the world reference frame so that the vertical direction is Z and the ground is near the `z = 0` plane.  It does so by assuming that the images are taken from similar altitudes and that the up vector of the images corresponds to the up vector of the world.


Camera Coordinates
``````````````````
The *camera coordinate* reference frame has the origin at the camera's optical center, the X axis is pointing to the right of the camera the Y axis is pointing down and the Z axis is pointing to the front.  A point in front of the camera has positive Z camera coordinate.

The pose of a camera is determined by the rotation and translation that converts world coordinates to camera coordinates.
