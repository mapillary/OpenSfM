Reporting
=========

OpenSfM commands write reports on the work done.  Reports are stored in the ``reports`` folder in json format so that they can be loaded programmatically.  Here is the list of reports produced and the data included.

Feature detection
-----------------
The report on feature detection is stored in the file ``features.json``.  Its structure is as follow::

    {
        "wall_time": {{ total time compting features }},
        "image_reports": [   # For each image
            {
                "wall_time": {{ feature extraction time }},
                "image": {{ image name }},
                "num_features": {{ number of features }}
            },
            ...
        ]
    }

Matching
--------

The report on matching is stored in the file ``matches.json``.  Its structure is as follow::

    {
        "wall_time": {{ total time compting matches }},
        "pairs": {{ list of candidate image pairs }}
        "num_pairs": {{ number of candidate image pairs }},
        "num_pairs_distance": {{ number of pairs selected based on distance }},
        "num_pairs_time": {{ number of pairs selected based on time }},
        "num_pairs_order": {{ number of pairs selected based on order }},
    }

Create tracks
-------------

The report on tracks creation is stored in the file ``tracks.json``.  Its structure is as follow::

    {
        "wall_time": {{ total time computing tracks }}
        "wall_times": {
            "load_features": {{ time loading features }},
            "load_matches": {{ time loading matches }},
            "compute_tracks": {{ time computing tracks }},
        },
        "num_images": {{ number of images with tracks }},
        "num_tracks": {{ number of tracks }},
        "view_graph": {{ number of image tracks for each image pair }}
    }

Reconstruction
--------------

The report on the reconstruction process is stored in the file ``reconstruction.json``.  Its structure is as follow::
